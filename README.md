Can you spell your name with elements of the periodic table?


I spend a lot of time looking at the periodic table while brushing my teeth / taking a shower / ..., and trying to spell my name (or other words) with it. Figured I'd automate this process, so here we go. The code is shit, slow, I know, but hey. It does something. And it's a lot faster than my brain.

## Installing and running the package
Download the repository, and navigate with a terminal to the repository folder.

Install the package using pip: `pip install .`

Launch the python interpreter, and import the package: `import periodicname`.

At the moment, there is one function that works: `periodic_name()`. Use it as follows:

```
periodicname.periodic_name("Hello world")
```
